This repository documents my ongoing attempt to turn the 1st-generation Lenovo Legion Go into a modern Linux ultra-mobile PC (UMPC) with a gorgeous high-resolution display and three operating modes (gaming, laptop, tablet).

[Other efforts](https://github.com/aarron-lee/legion-go-tricks) have focused on porting SteamOS to this device and reinstating all the "gamer" features, like RGB lighting and fan curves. I am focusing on the desktop and tablet use cases.

The target platform is Fedora Silverblue with the GNOME desktop. I use a 3D-printed keyboard cover sold by [Tango Tactical](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1897686079/lenovo-legion-go-1-keyboard-attachment) that connects via Bluetooth.

## Disk encryption

A must for any portable device, yet this is very tricky to accomplish on the LGo because there is no native keyboard. To type a passphrase to perform a LUKS unlock, you have to plug in an external USB keyboard. (To add insult to injury, the unlock screen is in portrait orientation.)

Automatic unlock via TPM is one option, but this requires Secure Boot, which is also very tricky to achieve if you are using anything but the stock, Microsoft-signed Fedora kernel. Secure Boot also [cannot guarantee](https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/silverblue-docs/pull/176) the integrity of the kernel command line, among other things, because that would break the Silverblue boot process.

Currently, I unlock with a keyfile stored on a USB drive attached to my keyring. This can be done keyboard-free on Silverblue with just a couple of additions to kargs:

```
rd.luks.options=discard,keyfile-timeout=10s
rd.luks.uuid=luks-LUKS_UUID rd.luks.key=LUKS_UUID=/keyfile:UUID=USB_UUID
```

## mt7921e latency spike fix

Add `mt7921e.disable_aspm=1` to kargs. This does not make the crappy Mediatek card perform as well as an Intel one, but (I think) it helps.

## lgo1-tablet.service

Even though all of the LGo's accelerometers work out of the box, GNOME does not consider the device a convertible, and therefore will not auto-rotate the screen or display the on-screen keyboard. GNOME will only do this if one of the input devices emits the `SW_TABLET_MODE` event. (This is not true of many x86 convertibles, and certainly not of the LGo.)

This daemon looks for attached keyboards (using evdev) and creates a virtual input device to send the `SW_TABLET_MODE` event if *no* keyboards are attached. It also re-broadcasts volume key presses, because these buttons are considered an "internal keyboard" and are suppressed by libinput when in tablet mode.

With a Rust toolchain installed, build the daemon with `cargo build`.

## 61-sensor-local.hwdb

udev [includes](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/hwdb.d/60-sensor.hwdb) a rule for the LGo that accounts for Linux running the display in landscape rather than portrait. If we don't undo this, GNOME will constantly be 90-degrees off when it sets the display orientation. This file, to be placed in `/etc/udev/hwdb.d`, changes the `ACCEL_MOUNT_MATRIX` value for this sensor back to the identity matrix. To apply the fix, run `systemd-hwdb update && udevadm trigger`.

On Silverblue, it appears you also have to `systemctl mask systemd-hwdb-update.service` to prevent systemd from discarding this change at bootup.

## mutter-49.4-dont-reset-panel-rotation.patch

A recent [commit](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/4119/diffs?commit_id=e37021007de67e9358c9429fdf4f1f022a9c3ae3) changed Mutter to rotate the display to its native orientation when leaving tablet mode. This is a bad idea for a device that has a native portrait display, like the LGo, because it causes Mutter to rotate the display sideways. This patch deletes the code that causes the rotation; it is current for the version of Mutter shipped with Fedora 43. You can [build](https://blog.aloni.org/posts/how-to-easily-patch-fedora-packages/) your own custom package using fedpkg, and on Silverblue, you can install the resulting packages with something like:

```
# rpm-ostree override replace ./mutter-49.4-1.fc43.yoryan.x86_64.rpm ./mutter-common-49.4-1.fc43.yoryan.noarch.rpm
```
